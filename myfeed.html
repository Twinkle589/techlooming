        <h4>Let’s take a look at 5 different types of technology used around the world today.</h4>
        <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with the study and design of artificially intelligent systems.<br>

            <br>Artificial intelligence deals with the way an artificial system behaves, as opposed to how it responds to real-life situations. Unlike the human and animal intelligence, artificial intelligence exhibits emotionality and consciousness, whereas the latter exhibits behavior that is based on a machine or program controlling it.<br>
            
            <br>The difference between the two types of intelligence can be illustrated by the commonly used term ‘artificial intelligence’ itself.<br>
            
            <br>Artificial intelligence researchers are continuously looking for new ways to improve AI, especially as concerns about machine learning extend to applications outside of computer science. As more industries look to automation for increased efficiency, concerns about artificial intelligence are also increasing.<br>
            
            <br> Concerns about AI have led to increased interest in computer security, software patents, and other areas of research. As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in everyday life, experts will continue to look at these different concepts and how they affect society.<br>
            
            <br>Artificial intelligence has the ability to make decisions based on patterns and learned behavior, and can utilize previously programmed rules to perform everyday tasks. It has already revolutionized many areas of science, including medicine, transportation, and manufacturing.<br>
            
            <br>In recent years, experts have begun to study the effect of artificial intelligence on society at large, particularly the impact it will have on future artificially intelligent machines.<br>
            
            <br>Some researchers worry about the future rights of individuals to control the actions of such machines, while others are concerned about the future of business and job automation.</p><br>

            <br><h2>2. Space Technology</h2>
        <p>Space technology is an expansive field which employs a number of eminent scientists to fill its innumerable requirements. It also helps in space exploration and space station construction. Above all space technology saves many human lives in the future and even saves millions of lives so far.<br>

            <br>Many students get admission to various space related institutions so as to learn more about the technology.<br>
            
            <br>The space technology includes the technology like GPS systems, radio and imaging systems, telescopes etc. This branch of space science is gaining popularity gradually.<br>
            
            <br> Many students get admission to various colleges for furthering their education in this regard. There are many advantages of getting admission into a space-related institution.<br>
            
            <br>If you have any qualms or doubts regarding your interest in space technology then you can join any one of the courses offered in this subject.<br>
            
            <br>The basic qualification required for getting admission in such courses is a bachelor’s degree. Some of the common courses available are astronautical engineering, astronautical flight procedures, space mechanics, space technology, astronomy, and plasma physics.<br>
            
            <br>If you want to work in a space center then you can opt for astronautical positions. As per the present situation there is a huge requirement for skilled manpower in the aerospace industry, which can be fulfilled by taking up these courses.

        </p><br>

        <br><h2>3. Information Technology</h2><br>
        <p>What is Information Technology? AKA (IT)<br>

            <br>Information Technology, also known as Information Technology, is the use of computers and related equipment to collect, retrieve, organise or transmit data. Information technology is usually employed in the context of business functions rather than for personal or entertainment purposes.<br>
            
            <br>IT is still considered a subset of communications and information technology. It refers to any technologies designed to make information more useful, such as email, instant messaging, desktop publishing applications, spreadsheets, multimedia, web page design, music, videos, and more.<br>
            
            <br> The I.T industry, including computer software, engineering services, network and storage systems, information technology support, networking products, and peripherals, constitutes the majority of the global economy. Knowledge about, and use of, I.T technologies is increasing with the pace of technology and globalization.<br>
            
            <br>As information technology is becoming a vital part of our lives, job requirements for information technology professionals will continue to grow.<br>
            
            <br> Generally, those with a bachelor’s degree in computer information systems or computer engineering may choose to train for positions that involve designing, creating, implementing, supporting, or maintenance of computer systems.<br>
            
            <br>Higher positions require a higher level of expertise and increased responsibility. Positions such as a system engineer, a software engineer, a network administrator, a security analyst, a computer systems manager, or a computer information systems technician may require additional training after obtaining their bachelor’s degrees.<br>
            
            <br>A master’s degree will be especially helpful if you hope to become a professional software engineer, as most major employers favor candidates with a master’s degree.</p><br>

        <br><h2>4. Educational Technology</h2><br>
        <p>A systematic approach to all the resources and systems of education, including computer-based teaching and learning systems, educational technology, or EdTech. It refers to the multiple demands of people, adjusting technological solutions to academic teaching and on the measurement of student academic progress. It is used for enhancing the quality of education, making it relevant and interesting to students.<br>

            <br>Educational Technology is an important resource and application of information technology that affect education in a positive manner.<br>
            
            <br>The scope of EDtech is huge, ranging from traditional learning methods like print and visual media, to more current systems such as interactive learning tools, digital audio-visual systems and online learning. Educational Technology has contributed significantly to the fields of education and research.<br>
            
            <br>It is used for collecting, organizing, storing, disseminating, transmitting, aiding, and encouraging the education and knowledge of persons. Educational technology is generally used to give children and teachers the capability to learn faster, perform better, be able to access more, and have a richer experience in learning.<br>
            
            <br>The main goal of EDtech is to enhance learning processes. Educational technology helps in the creation of learning processes, and it includes the learning procedures, instructional materials, instructional practices and strategies, and other technological tools.<br>
            
            <br>There is a vast area of application of educational technology. It is very much necessary in the teaching and learning processes of the different subjects.</p><br>

        <br><h2>5. Aerospace Technology</h2><br>
        <p>This is a very important question as we become more dependent on technologies that rely on space flight, and aerospace engineering, which involves the design of planes, capsules, and even vehicles to take people and materials into space.<br>

            <br>Indeed, many aerospace engineers have developed a lot of very innovative and practical ways to use space technology for their own benefit and the benefit of mankind in space, such as using carbon composites for airframes and fuel cells for space shuttles, as well as developing better, more efficient wings for both airplanes and spacecraft. Therefore, while there are many potential applications for this growing field, not all of these innovative ways to use this technology are likely to be adopted, even by those who specialize in aerospace engineering.<br>
            
            <br>While some may still be confused about what this field actually is, the term was formally introduced by NASA in 1958.<br>
            
            <br>The reason for this was so that the United States could develop space vehicles which would not rely on Russian designs, as some of these designs were not very reliable or had serious issues. Therefore, aerospace engineering became a branch of space science, with an emphasis on creating vehicles that could not only function well in orbit, but one could also use them for research, travel, and even military purposes.</p><br>
